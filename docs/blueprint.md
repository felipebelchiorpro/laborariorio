# **App Name**: LabFlow Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Patient Registration: Form for registering patients with fields for Name, ID/CPF, Date of Birth, Exam Type, and Collection Date.
- Exam Table View: Display of all exams in a sortable table format with columns for patient info, exam type, date, and status.
- Status Indicators: Visual status indicators for each exam (Pending, In Analysis, Completed, Delivered).
- Search and Filter: Allows searching and filtering of exams by patient name, exam type, and date.
- Result Upload: Button to upload exam results, either as a PDF or a Google Drive link.
- Layout Adaptation: Responsive layout that adapts to desktop and tablet screens.
- Suggested Actions: AI tool to learn the administrator's workflow. For each new patient and/or Exam Type, the tool learns how the administrator manages the workflow (which actions and their order). The tool can suggest an 'optimal' set of actions or sequence of actions. Those would appear near the top of the screen for ease of access, but could be dismissed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#90CAF9), conveying trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5) for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#B39DDB) to highlight key actions and status indicators, maintaining a calm and modern feel.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used for all text. It will lend a modern and neutral look to the interface, and it works well for both headers and body.
- Dashboard layout with top navigation and side menu for easy access to main features. Rounded cards and smooth shadows to create a modern, user-friendly interface.
- Consistent use of simple, clear icons to represent different exam types and actions.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
